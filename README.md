All your data will be tied to a PC, no one will be able to access your data from another computer. 
Also the programm develops on Java that makes it cross-platform.

As easy as pie. Just find your data with search then copy them by pressing C-button.

When you first start, you must enter a super password that will be used to access the program. Take it carefully 
you will not be able to change it.

# Stability
I publish the program only after i started using it myself every day but i am still working on KeepYourPassword.
